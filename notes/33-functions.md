### **Introduction to Functions**

Functions are a fundamental building block of JavaScript applications. They allow developers to reuse code efficiently. A function is like a variable, but instead of holding a value, it holds multiple lines of code.

### **Defining and Calling a Function**

To declare a function:

1. Use the `function` keyword.
2. Give it a name.
3. Use parentheses `()` (which will later be used for parameters).
4. Use curly braces `{}` to define the function body (the code that runs when the function is executed).

Example of a simple function:

```js
function logger() {
  console.log("My name is Jonas");
}
```

To execute (invoke) a function, call it using its name followed by parentheses:

```js
logger();
```

Calling the function multiple times runs the code inside it multiple times.

### **Functions as Reusable Code Blocks**

Instead of repeating code throughout a program, a function allows you to write it once and reuse it whenever needed.

### **Functions with Parameters and Arguments**

A function can receive **parameters**, which act as placeholders for values. These are assigned values when the function is called. The values passed when calling the function are called **arguments**.

Example:

```js
function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges) {
  console.log(apples, oranges);
}
fruitProcessor(5, 0);
```

- `apples` and `oranges` are parameters.
- When calling the function with `fruitProcessor(5, 0)`, the arguments `5` and `0` are assigned to `apples` and `oranges`, respectively.

### **Returning Values from a Function**

A function can **return** a value, allowing it to produce a result that can be used elsewhere in the program.

Example:

```js
function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges) {
  const juice = `Juice with ${apples} apples and ${oranges} oranges.`;
  return juice;
}
const appleJuice = fruitProcessor(5, 0);
console.log(appleJuice);
```

- The `return` keyword sends back a value (`juice` in this case).
- The function call `fruitProcessor(5, 0)` gets replaced with `"Juice with 5 apples and 0 oranges."`
- This value is stored in `appleJuice` and logged to the console.

### **Reusability and Function Flexibility**

Since functions can take different arguments, they allow flexibility. The same function can process different numbers of apples and oranges:

```js
const appleOrangeJuice = fruitProcessor(2, 4);
console.log(appleOrangeJuice);
```

This produces:

```
Juice with 2 apples and 4 oranges.
```

Functions let developers write **generic** code that can handle various inputs dynamically.

### **Functions Without Parameters or Return Values**

Not all functions need parameters or return values. Some functions only execute tasks, such as logging messages.

Example:

```js
function logger() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
logger(); // Logs "Hello!" but does not return anything.
```

Since it does not return a value, storing its result in a variable would be meaningless.

### **Understanding Function Execution**

- If a function is **never called**, its code never runs.
- Calling a function multiple times executes its code multiple times.
- A function can return a value or just perform an action without returning anything.

### **The DRY Principle**

Functions help programmers follow the **DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)** principle, which promotes reusability and maintainability by avoiding repeated code.

### **Built-in Functions in JavaScript**

JavaScript includes built-in functions, like `console.log()` and `Number()`, which work similarly to user-defined functions.  
Example:

```js
console.log(Number("23")); // Converts string "23" to a number.
```

These built-in functions accept arguments, process them, and return results.

### **Conclusion**

- Functions are essential for writing **clean, reusable, and efficient code**.
- They can **take parameters, return values, or simply execute tasks**.
- Understanding how functions **take inputs, process data, and return outputs** is crucial for JavaScript programming.
- Reviewing and practicing function concepts is recommended to solidify understanding before moving on to more advanced topics.
