The speaker explains the concept of calling one function inside another function in JavaScript, a technique that beginners often struggle with. To illustrate this, they revisit the analogy of a fruit processor, which was initially designed to take a certain number of apples and oranges and produce juice.

Now, they introduce an additional requirement: the fruit processor can only process smaller fruit pieces. This means another function is needed to first cut the fruits into smaller pieces before making the juice.

### **Step 1: Creating a Function to Cut Fruit**

- A function called `cutFruitPieces` is defined, which takes a `fruit` as an input and returns the number of fruit pieces by multiplying the input by 4.
- For example, if given 2 apples, it returns 8 pieces.

### **Step 2: Modifying the Fruit Processor Function**

- The `fruitProcessor` function is updated to use `cutFruitPieces` to preprocess the fruits.
- `cutFruitPieces` is called with the number of apples received, and the result is stored in `applePieces`.
- Similarly, `cutFruitPieces` is called with oranges, and the result is stored in `orangePieces`.
- This demonstrates the concept of calling one function inside another.

### **Step 3: Understanding the Data Flow**

- When `fruitProcessor(2, 3)` is called:
  - The function receives `2` apples and `3` oranges.
  - It calls `cutFruitPieces(2)`, which returns `8`, stored in `applePieces`.
  - It calls `cutFruitPieces(3)`, which returns `12`, stored in `orangePieces`.
  - The final juice string includes the processed fruit pieces.
- The process is explained with arrows and examples to clarify how values are passed between functions.

### **Step 4: Why Not Multiply Directly Inside `fruitProcessor`?**

- Instead of directly multiplying apples and oranges by 4 in `fruitProcessor`, the speaker explains why extracting the logic into a separate function (`cutFruitPieces`) is beneficial:
  1. **Common Practice:** Calling functions within functions is common in JavaScript.
  2. **Avoiding Code Duplication (DRY Principle):** If the cutting machine logic needs to change (e.g., from cutting into 4 pieces to 3), updating it in one function (`cutFruitPieces`) is easier than modifying multiple places in `fruitProcessor`.
  3. **Scalability:** If there were 10 different fruit types to cut, maintaining the logic in a separate function makes the code cleaner and reduces the chance of errors.

### **Final Thoughts**

- The example reinforces the importance of function calls within functions.
- Over time, developers will develop an instinct for when to break code into separate functions.
- The speaker encourages learners to internalize this logic.
