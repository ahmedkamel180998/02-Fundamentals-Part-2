Hereâ€™s a detailed summary of the transcript:

### **Review of Functions**

The lecturer begins by summarizing key concepts about functions before moving on to other topics. The review includes rewriting a previously written function, converting it to a standard function expression, and exploring different ways of calling functions.

---

### **Converting an Arrow Function to a Function Expression**

- The lecturer takes a previously written arrow function (years until retirement) and converts it into a function expression.
- The conversion process involves removing the arrow (`=>`) and replacing it with the `function` keyword.
- This transformation helps reinforce the concept of function expressions.

---

### **Breaking Down Functions into Smaller Parts**

- The function is refactored to use a separate `calcAge` function.
- `calcAge` takes `birthYear` as input and returns `2037 - birthYear`, following the principle of code reusability.
- The lecturer clarifies that parameters with the same name in different functions are completely independent.
- The example of a variable called `birthYear` being used inside two different functions demonstrates this concept.

---

### **Function Data Flow Explanation**

- The lecturer traces the execution of `yearsUntilRetirement(1991, 'Jonas')`.
- The function calls `calcAge(1991)`, which returns `2037 - 1991 = 46`.
- The retirement years are then computed as `65 - 46 = 19`, which is logged to the console.

---

### **Handling Edge Cases (Retirement Already Passed)**

- The function is improved to handle cases where the person has already retired.
- If the computed retirement years are negative, the function returns `-1` instead.
- The lecturer explains that `-1` is commonly used in programming to indicate an invalid or special case.
- This is implemented using an `if-else` statement:
  - If retirement years are greater than 0, return the value.
  - Otherwise, return `-1` to indicate retirement.

---

### **Return Statement Behavior**

- The lecturer highlights the importance of the `return` statement in functions:
  - It immediately exits the function.
  - Any code after `return` is ignored.
- A practical demonstration is given:
  - Logging a message (`console.log()`) after a `return` statement will not execute.
  - To ensure the message is logged, it must be placed **before** the return statement.

---

### **VS Code Shortcuts**

- Quick demonstration of useful VS Code shortcuts:
  - `Option + Up` (Mac) / `Alt + Up` (Windows) to move lines up.
  - `Command + D` (Mac) / `Ctrl + D` (Windows) to select and edit multiple occurrences.

### **Types of Functions**

The lecturer reviews the three types of functions in JavaScript:

1. **Function Declarations**
   - Can be used before their definition due to hoisting.
2. **Function Expressions**

   - Stored in a variable.
   - Not hoisted like declarations.

3. **Arrow Functions**
   - A shorter syntax for functions.
   - Useful for simple one-liners.
   - Do not have their own `this` keyword (to be covered later).

Despite their differences, all function types:

- Receive input (parameters).
- Transform data inside the function body.
- Output a result (return value).

---

### **Detailed Breakdown of Function Structure**

1. **Function Name:** Identifies the function (`calcAge` in the example).
2. **Parameters:** Placeholders for input values (e.g., `birthYear`).
3. **Function Body:** Contains the logic that processes the input data.
4. **Return Statement:** Outputs the result and terminates the function.

---

### **Function Invocation**

- Functions are called using parentheses, e.g., `calcAge(1991)`.
- Arguments (actual values) replace parameters (placeholders).
- The function processes the input and returns an output.
- The returned value can be stored in a variable.

---

### **Console Logging vs. Returning Values**

- **Console Logging (`console.log()`)**
  - Used to print values to the developer console.
  - Does **not** return data from a function.
- **Returning (`return`)**
  - Outputs a value that can be used elsewhere in the program.
  - Functions without `return` output `undefined`.
